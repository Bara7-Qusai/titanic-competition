# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning. The code preprocesses data, engineers features, and trains a model using XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using various features such as age, gender, and ticket class. The dataset is provided by the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
